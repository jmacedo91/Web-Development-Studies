      <p>Hello, I'm a Chemist, a Data Science student and I work as a Laboratory Analyst at Pr√≥Lab Biotechnology.

      <p>I have been working for 11 years with physical chemistry analysis and application of statistical techniques to ensure the
        quality control of the results obtained in the laboratory.
        Participated in proficiency tests and audits by Inmetro for ISO 17025 certification.
        I am a Data Science student and I try to apply data analysis technologies
        in my routine to optimize control and inference in my results.
        I have a strong interest in chemometrics, statistical data analysis and programming.</p></td>
